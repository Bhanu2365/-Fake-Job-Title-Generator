# 🎩 PROJECT 2ND: Fake Job Title Generator

Welcome to the **Fake Job Title Generator** — a light-hearted and engaging Python project that randomly creates absurd and humorous job titles like:

> 🧠 *"Certified Meme Strategist"*  
> 🦄 *"Global Unicorn Engineer"*

This beginner-friendly project helps students practice Python fundamentals such as lists, random selection, string concatenation, and user interaction — all while having fun.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Generate fake, funny job titles using random word combinations.
- Teach and reinforce basic Python concepts:
  - Lists
  - The `random` module
  - String concatenation
  - Input and output functions

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create Lists**  
   Define three separate lists:
   - `adjectives` (e.g., *Certified*, *Dynamic*, *Global*)
   - `roles` (e.g., *Meme*, *Innovation*, *Unicorn*)
   - `suffixes` (e.g., *Strategist*, *Engineer*, *Guru*)

2. **Random Selection**  
   Use the `random.choice()` function to pick one word from each list.

3. **Build the Title**  
   Combine the three randomly selected words into a single string.

4. **Display the Result**  
   Print the final job title to the user.

5. **Repeat Option** *(Optional)*  
   Ask the user if they want to generate another job title.
